⭐ Q3 — Monitoring Tool: Nagios in Docker

We will use official Nagios XI or Nagios Core Docker image depending on what's easiest.
The most common fully working image is:

👉 jasonrivers/nagios

It is widely used in labs and works instantly.

🟩 STEP 1 — Pull Nagios Docker Image
docker pull jasonrivers/nagios


This image includes:

Nagios Core

Apache web UI

Default monitoring services (CPU, RAM, Uptime, Ping)

🟩 STEP 2 — Run Nagios Container
docker run -d \
  --name nagios \
  -p 8080:80 \
  jasonrivers/nagios


This maps:

Container port 80 → host port 8080

So you can access Nagios at:

👉 http://localhost:8080/nagios

🟩 STEP 3 — Default Login Credentials

Nagios default credentials:

username: nagiosadmin
password: nagios


If this doesn't work, use:

nagiosadmin / nagiosadmin

🟩 STEP 4 — Access Nagios Web Interface

Open your browser:

👉 http://localhost:8080/nagios/

(or sometimes just: http://localhost:8080
)

Login → you will see the Nagios Monitoring Dashboard.

🟩 STEP 5 — Show CPU, Memory, Service Uptime

Once logged in:

Go to Monitoring

Click Service Detail

You will see:

CPU Load

Memory Usage

Swap Usage

Uptime

Localhost checks

HTTP, SSH service checks

These pages are perfect for screenshots.
