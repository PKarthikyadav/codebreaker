Here is the fastest, simplest, exam-ready guide for Q2 – Minikube Nginx Deployment.
Just execute these exact commands and you will get full marks.

⭐ Q2 — Working with Minikube (Nginx Service Deployment)

This is extremely easy. Only 8 commands total.

🟩 STEP 1 — Start Minikube
minikube start


Wait until it finishes starting the Kubernetes cluster.

🟩 STEP 2 — Create an Nginx Deployment
kubectl create deployment nginx-app --image=nginx


Check it:

kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods


You should see 1 pod like:

nginx-app-xxxxxx   Running

🟩 STEP 3 — Expose Deployment as a Service on Port 8090

Expose the deployment:

kubectl expose deployment nginx-app --type=NodePort --port=80


Now you must map it to port 8090 on your machine using Minikube:

minikube service nginx-app --url


This will give output like:

http://192.168.49.2:31591


The port “31591” is a random NodePort.
But we want it on localhost:8090.

So we run:

kubectl port-forward service/nginx-app 8090:80


This means:

Kubernetes service port 80

Forward to local port 8090

🟩 STEP 4 — Verify in Browser

Open your browser and go to:

👉 http://localhost:8090

You should see the Nginx welcome page.

Take a screenshot for your exam.

🟩 STEP 5 — List all Pods and Services
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services


Expected services:

nginx-app   NodePort   80:31591/TCP   1m
kubernetes  ClusterIP  ...
